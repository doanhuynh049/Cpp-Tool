TIBCO Software Inc. End User License Agreement

READ  THIS  END  USER LICENSE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING
THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT  AGREE  TO
THESE  TERMS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND RETURN IT TO THE VEN-
DOR FROM WHICH IT WAS PURCHASED.

Upon your acceptance as indicated above, the following shall govern your use of
the  Software  except  to  the extent all or any portion of the Software (a) is
subject to a separate written agreement, or (b) is provided by  a  third  party
under  the terms set forth in an Addenda at the end of this Agreement, in which
case the terms of such addenda shall control over inconsistent terms  with  re-
gard to such portion(s).

License  Grant.   The Software is the property of TIBCO or its licensors and is
protected by copyright and other laws. While TIBCO continues to own  the  Soft-
ware,  TIBCO  hereby grants to Customer a limited, non-transferable, non-exclu-
sive, license to use the Number of Units set forth  in  the  Ordering  Document
solely for Customer's internal business use.

License  Term.   The term of each license for the Software shall be either per-
petual or on a term limited basis as set forth in the Ordering Document. If li-
censed  on  a term limited basis, the term shall be for a period of three years
commencing on the Purchase Date, and on expiration, Customer must  cease  using
and return or destroy all copies of the Software.

Restrictions.   Customer  agrees not to (a) make more copies than the Number of
Units (except for a reasonable number of copies for archival and  disaster  re-
covery  purposes)  or  use any unlicensed versions of the Software; (b) provide
access to the Software to anyone other than employees, contractors, or  consul-
tants  under  written  contract  with Customer agreeing to be bound by terms at
least as protective of TIBCO as those in this End User License Agreement  ("Au-
thorized  Users");  (c)  sublicense,  transfer, assign, distribute to any third
party, pledge, lease, rent, or commercially share the Software or any  of  Cus-
tomer's rights under this Agreement (for the purposes of the foregoing a change
in control of Customer is deemed to be an assignment); (d) use the Software for
purposes  of providing a service bureau, including, without limitation, provid-
ing third-party hosting, or third-party application integration or  application
service  provider-type  services, or any similar services; (e) use the Software
in connection with ultrahazardous activities, or any activity for which failure
of the Software might result in death or serious bodily injury to Customer or a
third party; or (f) directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, modify, trans-
late, reverse engineer, decrypt, decompile, disassemble, make error corrections
to, create derivative works based on, or  otherwise  attempt  to  discover  the
source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of the Software. Customer may en-
gage in such conduct as is necessary to  ensure  the  interoperability  of  the
Software  as  required by law, provided that prior to commencing any decompila-
tion or reverse engineering of any Software, Customer agrees to  it  shall  ob-
serve  strict  obligations  of confidentiality and provide TIBCO reasonable ad-
vance written notice and the opportunity to assist with and/or conduct such ac-
tivity  on Customer's behalf and at Customer's expense; and (g) notwithstanding
the method of delivery of the Software, the scope of the licenses granted under
this  Agreement  are  limited to the Software as set forth in an Ordering Docu-
ment.

Beta and Evaluation Licenses.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if  the  Software
is being provided for demonstration, beta testing, or evaluation purposes, then
Customer agrees (a) to use the Software solely for such purposes, (b) that  the
Software  will  not be used or deployed in a production or development environ-
ment, and (c) that such use shall automatically terminate upon the  earlier  of
thirty  days from the date Customer receives the right to install the Software,
or Customer's receipt of notice of termination from TIBCO.

Maintenance.  Maintenance, if ordered, including first year and all  subsequent
years,  is  provided  under  the  policies set forth in the Maintenance Program
Guide in effect at the time Maintenance services are provided. The policies set
forth  in  the  Maintenance  Program Guide, incorporated in this Agreement, are
subject to change at TIBCO's discretion; however the level of Maintenance  ser-
vice  provided  by  TIBCO  will not be materially reduced during the period for
which Maintenance fees have been paid by Customer. The current version  of  the
Maintenance Program Guide can be accessed at http://www.tibco.com/services/sup-
port/default.jsp. To receive Maintenance, all Software  must  be  properly  li-
censed  and  annual  Maintenance  fees paid. TIBCO is not obligated to continue
providing Maintenance if annual Maintenance fees have not been paid.

Services.  Customer may request additional services ("Services") either  in  an
Ordering  Document, or by a separate mutually executed work order, statement of
work or other work-request document incorporating the term of this End User Li-
cense Agreement (each, a "Work Order"). Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in
a Work Order, all Services and any work product therefrom  shall  be  (a)  per-
formed  on  a  time and materials basis, plus meals, lodging, travel, and other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith, (b) deemed accepted  upon
delivery,  and (c) exclusively owned by TIBCO (except for Confidential Informa-
tion of Customer), including all right, title and intellectual property or oth-
er  right or interest therein. Each Work Order is intended to constitute an in-
dependent and distinct agreement of  the  parties,  notwithstanding  that  each
shall  be  construed  to incorporate all applicable provisions of this End User
License Agreement.

Limited Warranty.  If Customer obtained the Software directly from TIBCO,  then
TIBCO  warrants  that  for a period of thirty (30) days from the Purchase Date:
(i) the media on which the Software is furnished will be free of defects in ma-
terials  and  workmanship under normal use; and (ii) the Software will substan-
tially conform to its Documentation. This limited warranty extends only to  the
original  Customer  hereunder. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and the en-
tire liability of TIBCO and its licensors under this limited warranty will  be,
at  TIBCO's option, repair, replacement, or refund of the Software and applica-
ble Maintenance fees, in which event this End User License Agreement shall ter-
minate upon refund thereof.

This  warranty  does  not apply to any Software which (a) is licensed for beta,
evaluation, testing or demonstration purposes for which TIBCO does not  receive
a  license  fee, (b) has been altered or modified, except by TIBCO, (c) has not
been installed, operated, repaired, or maintained in accordance  with  instruc-
tions  supplied  by TIBCO, (d) has been subjected to abnormal physical or elec-
trical stress, misuse, negligence, or accident, or (e) is used in violation  of
any other term of this End User License Agreement. Customer agrees to pay TIBCO
for any Maintenance or Services provided by TIBCO related to a  breach  of  the
foregoing  on  a time, materials, travel, lodging and other reasonable expenses
basis. If Customer obtained the Software from a TIBCO reseller or  distributor,
the terms of any warranty shall be as provided by such reseller or distributor,
and TIBCO provides Customer no warranty with respect to such Software.

EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY,  THE  SOFTWARE,  MAINTENANCE  AND
SERVICES  ARE  PROVIDED "AS IS", ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTA-
TIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY  IMPLIED  WARRANTY  OR
CONDITION  OF  MERCHANTABILITY,  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGE-
MENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE
PRACTICE,  ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW. CERTAIN
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE MAY BE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER ALONG WITH CERTAIN TIBCO SOFT-
WARE AS AN ACCOMMODATION TO CUSTOMER. THIS THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS
IS". CUSTOMER MAY CHOOSE NOT TO USE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE PROVIDED AS AN  ACCOM-
MODATION  BY  TIBCO. NO WARRANTY IS MADE REGARDING THE RESULTS OF ANY SOFTWARE,
MAINTENANCE OR SERVICES OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE WITHOUT ERRORS, PROB-
LEMS  OR INTERRUPTIONS, OR THAT ERRORS OR BUGS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECT-
ED, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE'S FUNCTIONALITY, MAINTENANCE  OR  SERVICES  WILL  MEET
CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS. NO TIBCO DEALER, DISTRIBUTOR, AGENT OR EMPLOYEE IS AU-
THORIZED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS, EXTENSIONS OR ADDITIONS TO THIS WARRANTY.

Indemnity.  If Customer obtained the Software from TIBCO directly,  then  TIBCO
agrees  at its own expense to defend or, at its option, to settle, any claim or
action brought against Customer to the extent it is based on a claim  that  the
unmodified  Software  infringes any patent issued by the United States, Canada,
Australia, Japan, or any member of the European Union, or any copyright, or any
trade secret of a third party; and TIBCO will indemnify and hold Customer harm-
less from and against any damages, costs and fees reasonably incurred  (includ-
ing  reasonable  attorneys' fees) that are attributable to such claim or action
and which are assessed against Customer in a final judgment; provided that TIB-
CO is promptly notified in writing of such claim, TIBCO has the exclusive right
to control such defense and/or settlement, and Customer shall  provide  reason-
able  assistance (at TIBCO's expense) in the defense thereof. In no event shall
Customer settle any claim, action or proceeding without TIBCO's  prior  written
approval.  In the event of any such claim, litigation or threat thereof, TIBCO,
at its sole option and expense, shall (a) procure for  Customer  the  right  to
continue  to  use the Software or (b) replace or modify the Software with func-
tionally equivalent software. If such settlement or modification is not commer-
cially  reasonable  (in the reasonable opinion of TIBCO), TIBCO may cancel this
End User License Agreement upon sixty days prior written  notice  to  Customer,
and refund to Customer the unamortized portion of the license fees paid to TIB-
CO by Customer based on a five-year straight-line  depreciation.  This  Section
states  the  entire  liability of TIBCO with respect to the infringement of any
intellectual property rights, and Customer hereby expressly  waives  any  other
liabilities  or obligations of TIBCO with respect thereto. The foregoing indem-
nity shall not apply to the extent any infringement could have been avoided  by
use of the then-current release.

Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED UNDER INDEMNITY OR RESULTING FROM A
BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY (THE "EXCLUDED MATTERS"), IN  NO  EVENT  WILL  EITHER
PARTY  OR  TIBCO'S  LICENSORS  BE  LIABLE FOR ANY LOST DATA, LOST REVENUE, LOST
PROFITS, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR  ANY  OTHER  INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL,  CONSEQUENTIAL,  SPECIAL,  PUNITIVE,  EXEMPLARY OR ANY SIMILAR TYPE
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE USE OR  THE  INABILITY  TO  USE  THE
SOFTWARE,  OR THE PROVISION OF ANY MAINTENANCE OR SERVICES, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR THE  EXCLUDED  MAT-
TERS,  IN  NO  EVENT SHALL A PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
TORT (INCLUDING ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF  WARRANTY,  CLAIMS  BY
THIRD  PARTIES OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE PRICE PAID BY CUSTOMER UNDER THE APPLI-
CABLE ORDERING DOCUMENT.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE-STATED REMEDY OR LIMIT-
ED  WARRANTY  FAILS  OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDIC-
TIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL  DAM-
AGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER.

Confidentiality.   "Confidential  Information" means the terms of this End User
License Agreement; all information marked by the disclosing  party  as  propri-
etary  or confidential; any provided software, related documentation or related
performance test results derived by Customer; and any methods, concepts or pro-
cesses utilized in provided software or related documentation. Confidential In-
formation shall remain the sole property of the disclosing party and shall  not
be disclosed to any non-Authorized User of either TIBCO or Customer without the
prior written consent of the disclosing party. If Confidential  Information  is
communicated orally, such communication shall be confirmed as "Confidential" in
writing within thirty days of such disclosure. The parties agree to protect the
Confidential Information of the other in the same manner it protects the confi-
dentiality of similar information and data of its own (and at all  times  exer-
cising  at least a reasonable degree of care). Except with respect to the Soft-
ware, items will not be deemed Confidential Information if (i) available to the
public  other  than by a breach of an agreement with TIBCO, (ii) rightfully re-
ceived from a third party not in breach of any obligation  of  confidentiality,
(iii)  independently developed by one party without use of the Confidential In-
formation of the other; (iv) known to the recipient at the time  of  disclosure
(other  than  under  a separate confidentiality obligation); or (v) produced in
compliance with applicable law or court order, provided the other party is giv-
en reasonable notice of the same. Both parties agree to indemnify the other for
any damages the other may sustain resulting from their unauthorized use  and/or
disclosure  of the other's Confidential Information. Such damages shall include
reasonable expenses incurred in seeking both legal and equitable  remedies.  To
the extent required by law, at Customer's request, TIBCO shall provide Customer
with the interface information needed to achieve interoperability  between  the
Software  and  another independently created program, on payment of TIBCO's ap-
plicable fee. Customer agrees to observe obligations  of  confidentiality  with
respect to such information.

To  the  extent TIBCO is exposed to individual personal data owned or otherwise
held by Customer during the provision of Services, which is subject to  various
data  protection  laws  and/or  regulations ("Protected Data"), TIBCO agrees to
treat such Protected Data in accordance with the Customer Privacy and  Security
Statement  set  forth  at http://www.tibco.com/customer_privacy_security_state-
ment.jsp (the "Statement"). The policies and procedures set forth in the State-
ment  as  well  as  those  set forth in the Data Protection Policy Statement at
http://www.tibco.com/resources/data_protection_statement.pdf are  in  place  to
meet  TIBCO's  obligations for the protection, integrity and confidentiality of
any Protected Data which exceed TIBCO's standard obligations to safeguard  Con-
fidential Information.

Export.   Software, including technical data, is subject to U.S. export control
laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its  associated  regula-
tions,  and  may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
Customer agrees to comply strictly with all such regulations and agrees to  ob-
tain all necessary licenses to export, re-export, or import Software.

Government  Use.   If  the  Software, Maintenance or Services are being or have
been acquired with U.S. Federal Government funds, or Customer is an agency, de-
partment,  or  other entity of the United States Government ("Government"), the
use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure  or  transfer
of  the  Software, Maintenance or Services, or any related documentation of any
kind, including technical data, or manuals, is restricted  in  accordance  with
Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian agencies and Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military agencies. The Software,
Maintenance  and Services are COMMERCIAL ITEMS AS DEFINED BY THE FEDERAL ACQUI-
SITION REGULATION. Use of the Software, Maintenance and Services by the Govern-
ment  is  further  restricted  according to the terms of this Agreement and any
amendment hereto.

Orders.  An Ordering Document means any purchase  order,  similar  document  or
agreement  requesting  Software, Maintenance or Services, which shall be deemed
accepted only by issuance of a TIBCO invoice and solely for purposes of  admin-
istrative  convenience.  None of the terms of the Ordering Document (other than
the Software product name, Number of Units, level of  Maintenance,  description
of  Services,  and fees due in connection therewith) shall apply for any reason
or purpose whatsoever, regardless of any statement on any Ordering Document  to
the  contrary, unless countersigned by an officer of TIBCO. This Agreement con-
stitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to  the  use  of
the  Software,  Maintenance and Services, and supersedes all proposals, oral or
written, and all other representations, statements, negotiations and  undertak-
ings relating to the subject matter hereof. All orders of Software, Maintenance
or Services by Customer to TIBCO shall be deemed to occur with or without  ref-
erence to, under the terms of this End User License Agreement, unless expressly
superseded by a signed written agreement between the parties. Neither  the  li-
cense  to  use the Software granted in this Agreement nor the obligation to pay
the license fees set forth above are dependent upon the performance by any par-
ty  of  any  Services  or  the supply of any other software program or product.
Software shall be delivered electronically, and delivery deemed  complete  when
the Software is made available for download by Customer.

Termination.   Maintenance  or  Services may be terminated: (a) by either party
upon a default of the other, such default remaining uncured  for  fifteen  days
from  written  notice  from  the  non-defaulting party; (b) upon the filing for
bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, (c) by  either  party  upon  prior
written  notice at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of any annual Mainte-
nance term; or (d) by Customer (for Services), upon ten days prior written  no-
tice  or  30  days prior written notice by TIBCO. Termination of Maintenance or
Services shall not terminate this End User License Agreement. Customer may ter-
minate  this End User License Agreement in its entirety at any time by destroy-
ing all copies of the Software. Upon termination or expiration of this End User
License  Agreement  in  its entirety, for any reason, Customer must cease using
and return or destroy all copies of the Software. Customer's obligation to  pay
accrued  charges and any fees due as of the date of termination, as well as the
sections entitled "Confidentiality", "Limited Warranty" and "Limitation of Lia-
bility" shall survive any such termination.

Authority.   You  hereby represent and warrant that you have full power and au-
thority to accept the terms of this End User License  Agreement  on  behalf  of
Customer,  and that Customer agrees to be bound by this End User License Agree-
ment.

Definitions.  In connection with this End User License Agreement Software prod-
uct  definitions  are  as set forth at http://tibco.com/software/productdefini-
tions.jsp which are hereby incorporated into the End User License Agreement and
the  following  capitalized  terms shall have the following meaning: "Customer"
means the original purchaser or licensee of the Software and any permitted suc-
cessors  and  assigns; "Documentation" means text material that accompanies the
Software on delivery, which describes how to make use of that software. "Enter-
prise"  means  an unlimited Number of Units of the Software set forth in an Or-
dering Document as Enterprise, to be deployed by Customer during  a  period  of
one year (or such other period of time set forth in the Ordering Document) from
the Purchase Date (the "Enterprise Term"), at which time, the Number  of  Units
then  deployed  in  Production and Non-Production use by Customer becomes fixed
and Customer may not thereafter deploy additional Units. During the  Enterprise
Term,  Customer's  right to deploy an unlimited Number of Units does not extend
to any entity which acquires, is acquired by, merged into,  or  otherwise  com-
bined with Customer. Customer hereby agrees to provide TIBCO, within sixty (60)
days after the end of the Enterprise Term, with written notice of the Number of
Units  deployed  at the end of the Enterprise Term by Unit and License Type. In
the event Customer elects to renew Maintenance (subject to the section entitled
"Termination"), then during the Enterprise Term and for the first annual renew-
al thereafter, TIBCO agrees the annual Maintenance fee  for  the  Software  li-
censed  on  an  Enterprise basis shall not increase by more than the percentage
rate change in the United States Department of Labor - Consumer Price Index for
All  Urban  Consumers (CPI-U) for the twelve month period immediately preceding
the anniversary date of Maintenance. "Purchase Date" means the date the  Order-
ing Document is accepted by TIBCO. "Project" means an unlimited Number of Units
of the Software set forth in an Ordering Document as Project, to be deployed by
Customer  solely  in  connection with the description and scope of the Customer
project set forth in the Ordering Document, during a period  of  one  year  (or
such  other  time  period set forth in the Ordering Document) from the Purchase
Date (the "Project Term"), at which time, the Number of Units then deployed  in
Production  and  Non-Production  use by Customer becomes fixed and Customer may
not thereafter deploy additional Units. During  the  Project  Term,  Customer's
right  to  deploy an unlimited Number of Units does not extend beyond the scope
of the Project as set forth herein or to any entity which acquires, is acquired
by, merged into, or otherwise combined with Customer. Customer hereby agrees to
provide TIBCO, within sixty (60) days after the end of the Project  Term,  with
written  notice  of the Number of Units deployed at the end of the Project Term
by Unit and License Type. In the event Customer  elects  to  renew  Maintenance
(subject  to  the section entitled "Termination"), then during the Project Term
and for the first annual renewal thereafter, TIBCO agrees  the  annual  Mainte-
nance  fee  for  the Software licensed on a Project basis shall not increase by
more than the percentage rate change in the United States Department of Labor -
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the twelve month peri-
od immediately preceding the anniversary date of Maintenance. "Severity"  means
the  impact  levels of an error, defect or malfunction, which under Maintenance
are determined by TIBCO as follows: "Severity 1"  is  an  emergency  production
situation  where  the  Software is totally inoperable or fails catastrophically
and there is no workaround; "Severity 2" is a detrimental situation (and  there
is no workaround) where (a) performance degrades substantially under reasonable
loads causing a severe impact on use, (b) the Software is usable but materially
incomplete;  or  (c)  one or more mainline functions or commands is inoperable;
"Severity 3" is where the Software is usable, but does not provide  a  function
in  the most convenient manner; and "Severity 4" is a minor problem or documen-
tation error. "Software" means the most  current,  generally  available  object
code  version  on all Platforms then currently available. Software does not in-
clude multiple Platforms if the software product licensed on a Platform specif-
ic  basis  as designated in the Software product name or as otherwise listed in
an Ordering Document, including its Documentation and  any  subsequent  Updates
provided  under  Maintenance. For the purposes of the product definitions where
"TIBCO Software" or "Licensor Software" is used it shall have the same  meaning
as  "Software".  "TIBCO" means TIBCO Software Inc. and any entities, regardless
of corporate status, controlled by, controlling, or under common  control  with
TIBCO  Software  Inc. "Updates" means Software bug fixes, enhancements, and up-
dates, if and when made generally available by TIBCO.  Updates  provided  under
Maintenance,  warranty  or which are provided for any other reason by TIBCO, or
TIBCO's authorized resellers or distributors (if applicable),  are  subject  to
the license rights, limitations and restrictions of the End User License Agree-
ment.

Special Product Provision.  Embedded/Bundled Products. Some Software embeds  or
bundles  other  Software. Use of such embedded or bundled Software is solely to
enable the functionality of the Software licensed under this Agreement, and may
not  be  used or accessed by any other Software, or for any other purpose. Bun-
dle. A collection of Software listed in TIBCO's then current price book  to  be
sold together under a collective name such as "XXX Bundle" which consists of X,
Y and Z. The Software which comprises a Bundle must be used in accordance  with
any  specific license restrictions imposed in this Agreement and solely in con-
junction with the components of the Bundle; provided that  a  Bundle  component
may  be  accessed  by or communicate with other Software separately licensed by
Customer. In no event may the Software which comprises a Bundle be  used  on  a
standalone  basis.  A Bundle is sold at a discount to the cost of licensing the
individual components due to the restrictions imposed on the use of the  Bundle
by  this  section  and any specific license restrictions imposed by this Agree-
ment. If the terms of this Agreement with regard to a Bundle are breached,  and
such  breach  is  not cured within ten (10) days of TIBCO notifying Customer in
writing of the breach, TIBCO shall be entitled to invoice Customer for the list
price of the individual components of the Bundle based upon the manner in which
Customer has deployed and is making use of the components.  Open  Source  Soft-
ware.  If  Customer uses open source software or any other third party software
not supplied by TIBCO in conjunction with the Software,  Customer  must  ensure
that  its  use  does  not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of use
with respect to the Software; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any  third
party  any  rights to or immunities under TIBCO's intellectual property or pro-
prietary rights in the Software. Customer also may not  combine  Software  with
programs  licensed  under  the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner
that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Software or
any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL. Third Par-
ty Software. Third Party Software means third-party software identified by  its
company  and/or product name, the provision of which by TIBCO is made solely as
an accommodation and in lieu of Customer purchasing a license  to  Third  Party
Software directly from the third party vendor.

General.   All  payments of fees due shall be made in U.S. dollars, net 30 from
Purchase Date, or, for any other amounts coming due hereafter, net 30 from TIB-
CO's invoice. Fees do not include sales, use, withholding, value-added or simi-
lar taxes, and Customer agrees to pay all sales, use,  value-added,  goods  and
services,  consumption, withholding, excise and any other similar taxes or gov-
ernment charges, exclusive of TIBCO's income tax. Customer  agree  to  pay  all
reasonable  costs incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in collecting
past due amounts. Except as set forth in the sections entitled "Limited Warran-
ty" and "Indemnity" all fees paid under or in connection with this End User Li-
cense Agreement are non-refundable and no right of set-off  exists.  A  service
charge  of  one  and one-half percent per month will be applied to all invoices
that are not paid on time. No delay in the performance of any obligation by ei-
ther  party,  excepting  all  obligations  to  make payment, shall constitute a
breach of this End User License Agreement to the extent  caused  by  force  ma-
jeure.  Customer  hereby grants TIBCO and its independent auditors the right to
audit Customer's compliance with this End User License Agreement. If  any  por-
tion  of  this End User License Agreement is found to be void or unenforceable,
the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

Governing Law.  This End User License Agreement shall be governed by  and  con-
strued in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of
America, as if performed wholly within the state and without giving  effect  to
the  principles  of conflict of law. The United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is excluded from application hereto.
