Options databases: local.opt and remote.opt
===========================================

The file 'local.opt' contains the options required to run the
tutorial programs; the 'remote.opt' file references in the online
documentation is simply the same file, but located on a remote
webserver. The name difference is meant to illustrate the difference
in locale, and not contents; therefore, the 'remote.opt' file is
simply a copy of 'local.opt', and requires placement in the document
serving location of your webserver to complete the tutorial's use of
a remote URL for option loading.
